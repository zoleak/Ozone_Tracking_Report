# Ozone Tracking Report
This project is based off an R shiny application developed to assist NJDEP's Air Monitoring team to track the current years ozone trends throughout NJ and it's surrounding states. This shiny application will be utilized by the planning team to get a pulse on the current year's ozone season.

R shiny was used to streamline the data review process so that anyone on the team could get an interactive snapshot of the data. Inside the app, users can interact with a leaflet map that shows all the different monitoring stations throughout NJ, PA, DE, NY and CT. Users can then view different tables showing key statistics for ozone data.
